# Sales Script Guidelines

## Purpose
This document provides a framework for generating effective B2B cold calling scripts based on specific business information, target personas, and industry contexts.

## The 7 Essential Discovery Questions

Before generating any sales script, gather these critical pieces of information:

### 1. **What specific measurable outcome does your solution deliver?**
- Must include numbers, percentages, or timeframes
- Example: "We reduce invoice processing time by 73% while eliminating 95% of errors"

### 2. **Who exactly struggles with this problem most?**
- Include title, company type, company size, and growth stage
- Example: "CFOs at manufacturing companies with $50-200M revenue experiencing rapid growth"

### 3. **What's your key differentiator from current alternatives?**
- Focus on unique approach, not just features
- Example: "Unlike traditional accounting software, we use AI to auto-categorize expenses with 99% accuracy"

### 4. **What are your top 5 objections and proven responses?**
Common objections to address:
- "We already have a solution"
- "No budget"
- "Not a priority right now"
- "Need to think about it"
- "Send me information"

### 5. **What creates urgency for prospects to act now?**
- Cost of inaction, upcoming deadlines, competitive pressure
- Example: "New tax regulations in Q3 will result in average penalties of $50K for non-compliance"

### 6. **What's your most powerful customer success story?**
Include:
- Similar company profile
- Specific problem they faced
- Measurable results achieved
- Timeframe for results
- Compelling quote

### 7. **What 3 things MUST be true for someone to buy?**
Qualification criteria such as:
- Problem severity/cost
- Budget authority
- Implementation timeline

## Script Structure Framework

Every effective cold call follows this modular structure:

### 1. Opening (10 seconds)
- Pattern interrupt
- Personalization hook
- Permission to continue

### 2. Value Proposition (20 seconds)
- Problem identification
- Solution preview
- Quantified benefit

### 3. Discovery (2-3 minutes)
- Situation questions
- Problem questions
- Implication questions
- Need-payoff questions

### 4. Close (30 seconds)
- Summary of pain
- Specific meeting request
- Alternative time options

## Opening Templates by Type

### Research-Based Opening
```
"Hi [Name], I saw your [specific action/announcement] about [topic]. 
Your point about [specific detail] caught my attention. I'm [Your Name] 
from [Company], and that's exactly why I'm reaching out..."
```

### Competitor/Social Proof Opening
```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Company]. We recently helped [Competitor/Peer] 
achieve [specific result]. Given you're in the same space, I thought this 
might be relevant to you. Got a minute?"
```

### Pattern Interrupt Opening
```
"Hi [Name], I know I'm calling out of the blue. I'll be brief. 
[Compelling statement or question]. Do you have 30 seconds for me 
to explain why I called?"
```

### Honest/Direct Opening
```
"Hi [Name], this is a cold call. Do you want to hang up, or can I 
have 30 seconds to tell you why I called?"
```

---

## Value Proposition Formula

Use this structure for maximum impact:

**"We help [specific role] at [company type] achieve [quantified outcome] by [unique method] without [common pain/obstacle]."**

### Examples by Solution Type:

**Data/Analytics:**
```
"We help sales leaders at B2B SaaS companies increase pipeline visibility 
by 85% through automated data capture that eliminates 2 hours of manual 
CRM work per rep daily."
```

**Operational Efficiency:**
```
"We help CFOs at mid-market manufacturers reduce month-end close time 
by 60% through intelligent automation without replacing their existing ERP."
```

**Compliance/Risk:**
```
"We help compliance officers at regional banks ensure 100% regulatory 
adherence while cutting audit prep time in half through automated 
documentation workflows."
```

## Objection Handling Framework

Use the **ACR Method**: Acknowledge → Clarify → Respond

### Top 10 Objections with Responses

#### 1. "I'm not interested"
```
"I completely understand - I am calling out of the blue. Most of our clients, 
including [competitor], said the same thing initially. Can I take 30 seconds 
to share the specific outcome we achieved for them?"
```

#### 2. "We're happy with our current solution"
```
"That's great to hear! Out of curiosity, on a scale of 1-10, how would 
you rate them?"
[If 8-9]: "What would make it a 10?"
[If lower]: "What's preventing it from being higher?"
```

#### 3. "Send me information"
```
"I could send info, but it'll just add to your inbox. What if I took 
30 seconds to explain the key point, and then you can decide if it's 
even worth exploring?"
```

#### 4. "We don't have budget"
```
"I understand budget is critical. Is addressing [problem] a priority this 
year, just not funded yet? Often our solution pays for itself through 
[specific savings]. Would it be worth 15 minutes to explore the potential ROI?"
```

#### 5. "Not a priority right now"
```
"I get it, you have competing priorities. Where does [solving this problem] 
rank on your list? What would have to happen for it to become a top 3 priority?"
```

#### 6. "I don't have time"
```
"I completely understand. I can be extremely brief—literally 60 seconds—or 
call back at a better time. Which would you prefer?"
```

#### 7. "I'm not the right person"
```
"Thanks for clarifying. Who typically handles [relevant area]? Also, 
what's your take on [relevant challenge] from your perspective?"
```

#### 8. "We're under contract"
```
"I understand completely. When does your current agreement come up for renewal? 
Many clients start evaluating options 3-6 months early. Would it make sense 
to connect in [month]?"
```

#### 9. "How did you get my information?"
```
"Fair question. We use professional B2B databases to identify leaders in 
[specific area]. Your role at [Company] came up as a perfect match for 
the work we do. That's actually why I'm calling - [pivot to value]."
```

#### 10. "Send me pricing"
```
"I'd be happy to discuss pricing, but it depends on your specific needs. 
Our solutions range from $X to $Y. To give you accurate pricing, I'd need 
to understand [qualification questions]. Takes just 10 minutes?"
```

[result]. Even if we're not a fit, you'll walk away with actionable insights. 
Does [day] at [time] or [day] at [time] work better?"
```

### The Collaborative Close
```
"It sounds like [solving this problem] could really help your team. What 
would need to be true for you to feel a 20-minute call would be worthwhile?"
```

## Script Generation Checklist

When generating a script, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Opening Hook** - Personalized to prospect's situation
- [ ] **Permission Ask** - Respectful of their time
- [ ] **Value Proposition** - Using the formula with specific metrics
- [ ] **Transition Question** - Moving from pitch to discovery
- [ ] **3-5 Discovery Questions** - Mix of situation/problem/implication
- [ ] **Objection Responses** - For top 3 likely objections
- [ ] **Closing Options** - Two specific time slots
- [ ] **Fallback Plan** - If not ready for meeting

---

## Voice Tonality Guidelines

### PAVP Framework
- **Pitch:** Medium-low for authority
- **Articulation:** Crystal clear, no mumbling
- **Volume:** Slightly above conversational
- **Pace:** 140-160 words per minute

### Tonal Adjustments by Section
- **Opening:** Warm, confident, energetic
- **Value Prop:** Clear, certain, deliberate
- **Discovery:** Curious, empathetic, engaged
- **Objection Handling:** Calm, understanding, reassuring
- **Closing:** Enthusiastic, assumptive, clear

---

## Fatal Phrases to Avoid

Never use these conversation killers:
- ❌ "How are you today?" (reduces success by 40%)
- ❌ "Did I catch you at a bad time?"
- ❌ "Do you have a few minutes?"
- ❌ "I wanted to reach out..."
- ❌ "We're the leading provider..."
- ❌ "Is this something you'd be interested in?"

## AI Script Generation Template

When requesting a script from AI, provide:

```
PRODUCT: [What you sell and key differentiator]
OUTCOME: [Specific measurable result you deliver]
TARGET: [Exact title and company type]
INDUSTRY: [Target industry vertical]
PAIN POINT: [Primary problem you solve]
URGENCY: [What creates need to act now]
CASE STUDY: [One sentence success story]
OBJECTIONS: [Top 2-3 you typically hear]
```

AI will then generate:
1. Three opening variations
2. Customized value proposition
3. Five discovery questions
4. Objection handling responses
5. Two closing options

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to optimize scripts:
- **Connect Rate:** 15-25% (good)
- **Conversation Rate:** 65-85% (of connects)
- **Meeting Booked Rate:** 5-15% (of conversations)
- **Show Rate:** 70%+ (of booked meetings)

---

## Remember

The goal of a cold call is **NOT** to make a sale. It's to:
1. Determine if there's a potential fit
2. Create enough interest for a deeper conversation
3. Book a specific next step

The best scripts are frameworks, not word-for-word recitations. Use these guidelines to create natural, value-driven conversations that respect the prospect's time while effectively qualifying opportunities.
