# Project Reorganization Report

**Date:** January 2025  
**Completed By:** PM Agent with BE, FE, and QA Agents  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary
Successfully reorganized the GB Sales Machine project structure to follow Next.js 14 best practices and improve maintainability.

## What Was Done

### 1. Folder Structure Reorganization
- ✅ Created route groups: `(auth)` and `(dashboard)`
- ✅ Moved authentication pages to `(auth)` group
- ✅ Moved dashboard pages to `(dashboard)` group
- ✅ Created proper service and component directories
- ✅ Established clear separation of concerns

### 2. URL Path Improvements
- ✅ Simplified auth routes: `/login` and `/register` (not `/auth/login`)
- ✅ Dashboard routes remain clean: `/dashboard`, `/campaigns`, `/leads`, `/billing`
- ✅ Onboarding flow: `/onboarding` → `/onboarding/discovery`
- ✅ Created comprehensive sitemap documentation

### 3. Navigation Updates
- ✅ Updated all internal links to use new routes
- ✅ Created shared layouts for route groups
- ✅ Added consistent navigation header for dashboard
- ✅ Fixed all broken imports

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Created `AGENT_WORKFLOW_RULES.md` for mandatory agent usage
- ✅ Created `SITEMAP.md` with complete route documentation
- ✅ Updated project documentation with new structure

### 5. Testing
- ✅ Created navigation tests with Playwright
- ✅ Verified all routes work correctly
- ✅ Ensured no broken links

## New Project Structure
